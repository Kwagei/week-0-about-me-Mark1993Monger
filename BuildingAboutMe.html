    <h2>My Experience At The KIT</h2> 
    <p>After a series of researching on which part of the specific area I should pay attention to, in the field of IT. I was inspired by <b>Mark Zuckerberg </b>and <br><b> Williams Bill Gate</b>
    on their contribution they has made in the world as a computer programmers. I was so expressed and desire to become a <br>
     programmer too but been to so  many computer that teaches computer programming but I couldn't see my way out. On faith day, I can accross <br> a friend of mine 
      who he's recommend to a programming school called KIT. <br> <br>

At KIT, I experienced good learning Enviroment, good presentation from the computer programmer lecturer lastly at KIT I experience that, KIT as a noble and eligible <br>
programming institution, they respect time and their concern of the all students who learning programming should know every topics given then them. <br> <br>

After some weeks with KIT, I experiece their entire teaching is all about student taking projects home everyday and doing assignment and given student the lastest <br>
  update of all things happening in the nationa and the world as well.

My main experience at KIT, test, quizes and assighment is given to the students regularly to know <br>  how much student  understanding their material they want to know if
 student are can read thier notes and watch video tutorial.
